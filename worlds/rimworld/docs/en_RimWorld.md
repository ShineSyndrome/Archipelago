# RimWorld (PC)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The reasearch tree is replaced with randomised multiworld checks. Researching these technologies will send the corresponding check out to the other world. Some checks will require access to the high-tech research bench and the multi-analyzer. 

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Depending on your selected options, any technology that requires research will be shuffled.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

In the current version of the mod, it's just the player's research technologies. But watch this space!

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, a notification will appear informing them of what they just received. For technologies that are received, the corresponding buildings and recipes related to that technology become unlocked and available for construction.
